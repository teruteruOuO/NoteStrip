	<h1>NoteStrip</h1>

	<p>
		This application allows you to record books, mangas, manhwas, manhuas, etc. that you really like! Name a book, provide an image 
		that uniquely identifies it from others, and optionally add more extra information around it such as its release and conclusion date, 
		and plot summary!
	</p>

	<p>
		You can also add a note for each book to remind yourself of any useful information about the book. It can record what chapter or moments
		that define why you like the book, your thoughts about it, and many more!
	</p>

	<p>
		On top of that, you can record every 10 hours rereading a  book, so that in the future, you'll know just how many times you've spent 
		reading a particular book
	</p>

	<p>
		There's also a dashboard page that shows your reading activity within the last seven, 15, or 30 days so that you're aware how much
		you've been reading. That page also shows the top books you've read based on your reading count.
	</p>

	<p>
		What are you waiting for? Start recording all the books you've read and like!
